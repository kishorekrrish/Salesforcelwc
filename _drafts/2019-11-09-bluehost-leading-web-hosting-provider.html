You will be sharing resources with multiple users using a secured server to host your website online. Bluehost provides affordable shared hosting services so you can find the perfect shared hosting package for your website needs.

A virtual private server is a virtual machine sold as a service. This is achieved by virtualizing a Dedicated server and dividing the resources among the users on that particular server. This means that you get to use your allocated resources (RAM and CPU) regardless of other users on the server. Where in shared hosting you are not guaranteed to get to use all the allocated resources promised.</div><div class="has-line-data" data-line-end="83" data-line-start="82"><img alt="Bluehost vps hosting pricing" src="/assets/images/vps-bluehost-pricing.png" /></div><div class="has-line-data" data-line-end="85" data-line-start="84"><br /></div><h3 class="code-line" data-line-end="87" data-line-start="86"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" id="Dedicated_Hosting_86"></a>Dedicated Hosting</h3><div class="has-line-data" data-line-end="88" data-line-start="87">Dedicated hosting is a website hosting service that provides the highest level of resource allocation, privacy, and control.
